# Colin Carter, MLaw
I'm a Swiss lawyer (MLaw) and legal engineer. My work revolves around the conception, design and implementation of innovative software and web interfaces that facilitate the seamless integration of law and IT. 
My focus and deep passion lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence and its application in the legal sector, underlined by a strong interest in UX and digitalisation in general. 
My current research explores the potential applications, implications and limits of AI within the legal profession.
As a PhD student, my research focuses on the complex issue of autonomous decision-making in criminal law.
